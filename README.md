Description: To create an Input Map, go to your "Shooter/Player"Â prefab's Inspector panel. In this panel select Add Component->Player Input->Create Actions. Then name your new Input Map as you wish and save it in the Scripts Folder inside the Assets Folder. 

A basic Input comes with three default actions(Move,Fire,Look).Later we will add Jumping, Double Jumping and Fast Movements and implement it with code. This is how your Input Map should like:
